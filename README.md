# Java
Here you'll find all my Java programs and projects that I have done over the years


The "Music Packs" are resource packs for Minecraft Java Edition, very outdated and the Artic Monkeys one never worked, last edition of Minecraft that were tested to be working was 1.16 or 1.17 but the pack when loaded says an older version because it was based on an older resource pack but it still works on these verions.
